            Silicon Valley Code Camp is put on by a dedicated group of
            volunteers whose mission is to both provide the highest quality
            content built around the topic of computer code, as well as create
            an environment where shared knowledge is paramount. The volunteers
            not only include the organizers, but all the speakers in Addition!!
